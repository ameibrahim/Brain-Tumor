                        Brain Tumors Overview

                    <p>
                        A tumor is caused by uncontrolled growth and abnormal spread of body cells that can result in death if not treated. Normally, cells multiply and die in an orderly way to be replaced by new cells. However, abnormal growth can keep happening to form a mass or a lump called a tumor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cancer is the second most frequent cause of mortality after heart disease. The American Cancer Society reported 2022 an estimated number of 18.280 deaths versus 25.050 new cases of brain and other nervous system cancer.                                              
                        In both adults and children, brain tumors are one of the most fatal and threatening cancers. Moreover, they have the lowest survival rate. Consequently, early diagnosis has an important role in preventing more spread of the tumor and identification of the right treatment plan. Examining Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images of the brain with tumors is an effective technique to distinguish brain tumors which is a difficult process even for a professional oncologist or a neurosurgeon which means that any tiny human error in the diagnosis will lead to undesirable consequences.  Notably, the number of brain tumor cases is increasing gradually which makes manual techniques tedious, time-consuming, and erroneous.
                        MRI is well-known for effectively finding some cancers like breast, brain, and spinal cord tumours. Using MRI, medical professionals can tell sometimes if a tumor is or is not cancerous. Furthermore, it helps plan treatment such as surgeries or radiotherapy (American Cancer Society, 2021).
                        Brain tumor diagnosis begins usually with MRI scans. When the MRI shows that the brain has a tumor then professionals head towards further investigations for example performing a biopsy procedure or surgery depending on the tumor type and severity of the patient's condition (Cancer.Net, 2019).

                            There exist multiple reasons why an individual may be more susceptible to having a brain tumor, and there are also elements that can raise that risk. Notably, many individuals with brain tumors have no recognized risk factors, thus even if these characteristics may be linked to an increased risk, they do not ensure the development of a brain tumor. As potential risk factors for brain tumors, the following variables have been identified:

                            As humans age, there is an increased chance of brain tumors. While medulloblastomas are more common in children, certain types of brain tumors, like gliomas, are more common in adults.

                            People may be more at risk if there is a family history of brain tumors. Brain tumor development is correlated with several hereditary diseases, including neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

                            It is well established that exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly during early life, increases the chance of brain tumor development. This can involve radiation treatment for different types of cancer, occupational radiation exposure, or radiation exposure from other sources.
